the program is simple

  if (argc == 2) {
    local_1c = atoi(*(char **)(argv + 8));
  }

  for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    if ((local_1c & 1 << ((byte)i & 0x1f)) != 0) {
      for (ii = 0; ii < 8; ii = ii + 1) {
        *(byte *)(*(long *)(chunks + (long)i * 8) + (long)ii) =
             *(byte *)(*(long *)(chunks + (long)i * 8) + (long)ii) ^ 5;
      }
    }

local_1c is set to the first param entered
there are many solutions to this, if you run the bash script u will see

but very simple xor ^ 5 when the if condition is met
we can easily bruteforce all the possibilities with the solve.sh one-liner, which is also very simple
this is maybe a good exercise on bit fiddling, idk. crackmes arent always super exciting
