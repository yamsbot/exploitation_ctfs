# Binary Exploitation Writeups
## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to help newbies who come across it get their feet wet with various binary exploitation challenges. This repo will be extremely unorganized, but will contain solutions to various challenges from the web. This is also for me to track my progress over time and so others may see that I am pushing my skillset further every day. 

## How to use
If you are working on a binary exploitation challenge and you are stuck, maybe you come across this repo and it contains the solution to what you are working on. I don't recommend being a paster, taking the code directly and using it to solve the challenge. I recommend reading that code and the comments I place along with it to understand the high level process we go through; guiding you to the next step in the challenge. 

## Disclaimer
I cannot promise that the code in this repo will be good, I write code that works, not code that runs extremely proficiently. Also I could be wrong on various things, like the words I use, I am always learning. Feel free to correct me in issues. Happy hunting!
